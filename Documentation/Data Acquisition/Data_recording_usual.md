4. Place the minitags on the machine. 
5. Switch on all the minitags.

# LABELING DATA

1. Keep the edge device connected to the router. 
2. Connect your computer to the Sensorkoffer_Dev Wifi. 
3. Use a terminal emulation software (for example PuTTY or SmarTTY) to access to the data on the edge device. 
4. Download the videos and CSV files. 
5. Before doing the labels, check that the sample time of the minitags is correct. For this, you can plot time(i) vs time(i+1) and you should get a line with slope of 5. 
6. An easy option for doing the labels is using a tool for creating subtitles (for example aegisub).
